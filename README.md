# Overview

## USA States

Here is an animation showing the evolution of covid19 in the USA (by state).
![Animation of US data by state from covidtracking](figures/covidtracking_states_eda1_zoom.gif)
Each point represents a state, the circle sizes are by the [estimated
population in
2019](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/state/detail/),
and the colors are by the total number of reported deaths (from white to
dark red). Notice we are using log-scales and total positives start
from 100. Some island states were not included because I lacked the
population data. Data taken from
[covidtracking](https://covidtracking.com/), mostly because it included
the number of tests performed on each state. Quality varies, see website
for details.

In the document [USA_STATE_RATES.md](USA_STATE_RATES.md) I describe the
(ongoing) resuls related to the inference of growth-rates using Gaussian
Process.
