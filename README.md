# Overview

This is a collection of resources, visualizations, and analysis
regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. For now it includes some graphical
representations, and an example on how to use Gaussian Process to infer
the rates of positive cases and deaths with time and with respect to
each other. Once the epidemic passes the goal will be to correlate the
dynamics of individual countries and US' states with their respective
responses, as well as some socio-economic metrics.

## Countries

## USA States

Here is an animation showing the evolution of covid19 in the USA (by state).
![Animation of US data by state from covidtracking](figures/covidtracking_states_eda1_zoom.gif)
Each point represents a state, the circle sizes are by the [estimated
population in
2019](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/state/detail/),
and the colors are by the total number of reported deaths (from white to
dark red). Notice we are using log-scales and total positives scale
begins from 100. A few states were not included because I lacked the
population data. Data taken from
[covidtracking](https://covidtracking.com/), mostly because it included
the number of tests performed on each state. Quality varies, see website
for details.

In the document [USA_STATE_RATES.md](USA_STATE_RATES.md) I describe the
(ongoing) resuls related to inferring rates using Gaussian Process.
