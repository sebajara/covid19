# Overview

This is a collection of resources, visualizations, and analysis
regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. For now it includes some graphical
representations, and an example on how to use Gaussian Process to infer
the rates (US only for now).

My goal is to eventually correlate the dynamics of individual countries
and US' states with their respective responses, as well as some
socio-economic metrics.

## Countries

Here is the number of cases and deaths per countries as by 29-05-2020.
![](figures/ecdc_countries_eda.png)
Only the top 50 countries (in number of cases were plotted). The scatter
plot on the right represents the state for the most current date. Data
taken from the [European
CDC](https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv). Scripts:
[update_alldata.sh](data/update_alldata.sh),
[countries_eda.py](src/countries_eda.py).

## USA by state

In the document [USA_STATE_RATES.md](USA_STATE_RATES.md) I describe the
(ongoing) resuls related to inferring rates using Gaussian Process.

Here is an animation showing the evolution of covid19 in the USA (by state).
![Animation of US data by state from covidtracking](figures/covidtracking_states_eda1_zoom.gif)
Each point represents a state, the circle sizes are by the [estimated
population in
2019](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/state/detail/),
and the colors are by the total number of reported deaths (from white to
dark red). Notice we are using log-scales and total positives scale
begins from 100. A few states were not included because I lacked the
population data. Data taken from
[covidtracking](https://covidtracking.com/).
