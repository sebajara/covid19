# Overview



## Data sources on Covid19

## Interesting analysis and commentaries on Covid19
* Analysis by Ourworldindata. Good charts and discussions. [ourworldindata](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
* Oxford is tracking goverment responses and the number of covid cases. [oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker)
* Genomic epidemiology of covid19 [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)
* Article on what is the "good" attitude one should have when doing data science on covid19 [How_To_Be_Curious_Instead_of_Contrarian_About_Covid19](https://rexdouglass.github.io/TIGR/Douglass_2020_How_To_Be_Curious_Instead_of_Contrarian_About_Covid19.nb.html)
* Article discussing some of the difficulties in modeling the infection, mostly on how data is constructed and hidden variables [why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/)  
* Collection of different statistical analysis and visualizations on
  covid19 data by people interested. [covid19dashboards](https://covid19dashboards.com/)
* The paper that changed the mind of the UK goverment on how to handle the virus. Historically relevant

* Interesting preliminary overview from concerned citizens. It makes
  sense overall, but can't vouch for their analysis [the-hammer-and-the-dance](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56)
