# Overview

This is a collection of resources, visualizations, and analysis
regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. For now it includes some graphical
representations, and an example on how to use Gaussian Process to infer
the time rates (in making).

My goal is to eventually correlate the dynamics of individual countries
and US' states with their respective responses, as well as some
socio-economic metrics.
